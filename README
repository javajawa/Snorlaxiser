== Snorlaxiser ==

Program that converts HTML text nodes that are the child of an arbitary root
node into the speech of Pokemon. The effect is achieved by estimating the
number of syllables in each word, and generating a psuedo-random string of
replacement syllables from a list of possibilities.

Currently, there are two deployable sections in the repo. The first is the
stand alone script file, which can be included and used in any webpage.
This is contained in the script/ directoy.
The chrome/ directory contains the files needed to make the Google Chrome
browser plugin.
